									<h1>Building a Hospital Database and Data Warehouse in SQLServer</h1>
									<p>Created a Database and Data Warehouse. Filled the Data Warehouse
										with Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers. Used scripts to 
										test the different functions.
									</p>
								</header>
								
								<h3>Project Objective</h3>
								<p>The purpose of this project was to explore the complexities of recording a patient event
									for a hospital database. The project does not attempt to build a whole hospital database.
									This would require more time and a much larger team then myself and two other classmates at
									Utah Valley University. 
								</p>

								<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ERD.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Above is the Electronic Relational Database (ERD) we created for our project.
									After deciding what type of data we wanted to record, our first step as a team
									was making the ERD. It displays the relationships between the tables and shows how we kept
									referential integrity. </p>
								<p>Once the ERD was created we created the tables script and ran it in SQL Server Management Studio.
									We then went to Mockaroo to generate random data to fill in the database and then ran the script. 
									Below are two links. The first is the script to create the database, the second is to the script
									that we created to fill the database.
								</p>

									<li><a href="https://github.com/christian-dalton/MockHospitalDatabase/blob/main/create_tables.sql" target = "_blank" class="button">Tables Script Link</a></li>
								</ul>
								<ul class="actions special">
									<li><a href="https://github.com/christian-dalton/MockHospitalDatabase/blob/main/fill_tables_script.sql" target = "_blank" class="button">Fill Tables Script Link</a></li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Creating the Data Warehouse</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/datawarehouse.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Above is the Star Schema Electronic Diagram we created for our Data Warehouse.
									The Data Warehouse was chosen to be a star schema because our objective was to
									record the patient event. The main benefit of using a star schema is that there is
									single large fact table to store primary measured data. The dimension tables
									surrounding it were used to store important supporting information.</p>
								
								<p>One important point to emphasize is that a database and data warehouse should not be 
									stored in the same database. If I were to be brought onto your team, I would keep them 
									separated. However, for the purpose of this project and the constraints of the class I 
									kept them in the same database. 
								</p>

									<li><a href="https://github.com/christian-dalton/MockHospitalDatabase/blob/main/create_datawarehouse.sql" target = "_blank" class="button">Data Warehouse Script Link</a></li>
								</ul>


								<h3>Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers</h3>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/TriggerExample.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The Triggers that we created for this project mostly deal with updating the Data Warehouse. 
									That way when a change is made to the database it will reflect in the non-fact table dimensions. 
									For filling the Facts table a procedure was used to do incremental updates (adding new rows of data).</p>

								<p>Procedures were used for a lot of different reasons. One example from this database
									is we nested a while loop within the stored procedure to create a list of dates From
									January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021. We included elements such as the raw date, day of
									the week, month of the year, quarter, and year number as part of it. Since it was in 
									the data warehouse it also include the getdate() built in function so that the dwDateDim
									table had a record of when it was done.
								</p>
								<p>Functions weren't used as often in this project but one example of it being used was to
									change admit date to the appropriate date id. This was used in the procedure to fill the 
									facts table.
								</p>
