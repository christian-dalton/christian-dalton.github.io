									<h1>What Attributes Cause NFL Wide Recievers to be Targeted?</h1>
									<p>Using nflfastR's play-by-play data this project takes an
										exploratory analysis of relatitonships between reciever targets 
										and other recorded variables. Then it looks to see if any of the
										recorded variables are major factors in what causes a player to 
										be targeted.
									</p>

								<h3>Project Objective</h3>
								<p>What metrics in nflfastR are predictive of a wide receiver on field value? 
									Or in other words, which metrics recorded in nflfastR’s play-by-play data 
									can be used to predict the number of targets a wide receiver will get during 
									an NFL season? </p>
								<h3>Research Methodology</h3>
								<p>I converted the nflfastR’s play-by-play data into season totals for all the 
									players using a foreloop. Then the players were then filtered out by receiving 
									epa (a metric only recorded for receivers) to isolate that position group. Players
									with fewer 10% of the teams targets were removed from the dataset to remove noise. 
									Finally all the data was adjusted to be on a per target basis and normalized to be 
									between 0-1 so as to not skew the model. </p>
								<p>All the machine learning models used k-fold cross validation, where the data was split up 
									into 5 different groups. The data then was rotated in with the formula 4 training, 1 testing. 
									This was repeated three times in each model, where the average of each model iteration was 
									taken to get the final results. The models we ran the data through was Linear Regression, 
									TreeBagging, Bayes GLM, and Neural Network. </p>
								<p>To determine which model was best we used the root mean square error (RMSE), 
									mean adjusted error (MAE), and R squared (R^2). The priority on deciding the best model was 
									first on R squared, then on the mean adjusted error, and finally the mean adjusted error.
									The best model then was used to predict the number of targets that a receiver should receive 
									based off its training tuning. The predictions column and the target column were then stored in a 
									dataframe along with the player id, player name and player season. To evaluate the models, the
									 absolute value of the difference between the targets and prediction columns were taken and stored 
									 into a new column. If the value was within plus or minus 7.5 of the actual targets, it was scored 
									 with a one. Labeling it a success. If it was outside of plus or minus ten it was labeled a failure. 
									 The model was then given a score based off its total accuracy rate.</p>
								<h3>Research Findings</h3>
								<p>The most predictive statistic in determining the success is Receiving Expected Points Added 
									(Receiving EPA). An individual players EPA is the sum of a players Expected Points (EP). 
									“EPA is the difference between the EP at the start of a play and the EP at the end of the play” 
									-advancedfootballanalytics.com. Even when adjusting for total receiving plays where they impacted 
									value by being targeted (Receiving EPA / Targets) it still accounts for 87.5% of the best model's 
									R squared (TreeBagging model).</p>
								<h3>Research Weaknesses and Limitations</h3>
								<p>Choosing Targets may not necessarily be the best metric in deciding WR value. From a Quarterback or play 
									calling perspective, targets may indictive of which player the team values over the course of a season. 
									However, in the analytics community value would be better identified as a metric such as EPA. Using that
									 as the dependent variable is another way to look at value. In addition, Player Salary would be the teams 
									 perception of expected value, and would hold another solid case for value in creating a model as it is a 
									 statement of value, even if it is likely strongly tied to their past performance and free agency market. 
									 However, Salary was not recorded in nflfastR and for the purpose of this analysis I wanted to keep the 
									 scope within nflfastR's data.
